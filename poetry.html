                            <h3>A Time to Talk</h3>

                When a friend calls to me from the road
                And slows his horse to a meaning walk,
                I don’t stand still and look around
                On all the hills I haven’t hoed,
                And shout from where I am, ‘What is it?’
                No, not as there is a time to talk.
                I thrust my hoe in the mellow ground,
                Blade-end up and five feet tall,
                And plod: I go up to the stone wall
                For a friendly visit.

                        <h3>A Poison Tree</h3>

                I was angry with my friend:
                I told my wrath, my wrath did end.
                I was angry with my foe:
                I told it not, my wrath did grow.

                And I waterd it in fears
                Night & morning with my tears;
                And I sunned it with smiles,
                And with soft deceitful wiles.

                <h3>I Knew A Man By Sight</h3>

                    I knew a man by sight,
                    A blameless wight,
                    Who, for a year or more,
                    Had daily passed my door,
                    Yet converse none had had with him.

                    I met him in a lane,
                    Him and his cane,
                    About three miles from home,
                    Where I had chanced to roam,
                    And volumes stared at him, and he at me.
