                    <h3>                A Time to Talk</h3>

                When a friend calls to me from the road
                And   slows his horse to a meaning walk,
                I don’t     stand still and look around
                On all the    hills I      haven’t hoed,
                And shout from where I am, ‘What is it?’
                No, not as      there is a time to talk.
                I thrust my hoe    in the mellow ground,
                Blade-end up         and five feet tall,
                And plod: I go up to     the stone wall
                For       a         friendly      visit.

                        <h3>                    A Poison Tree</h3>

                    I was angry with my friend:
                I told my wrath, my wrath did end.
                    I was angry with my foe:
                I told it not, my wrath did grow.

                    And I waterd it in fears
                Night & morning with my tears;
                    And I sunned it with smiles,
                And with soft deceitful wiles.

                    <h3>                I Knew A Man By Sight</h3>

                    I knew a man by sight,
                        A blameless wight,
                    Who, for a year or more,
                        Had daily passed my door,
                    Yet converse none had had with him.

                    I met him in a lane,
                        Him and his cane,
                    About three miles from home,
                        Where I had chanced to roam,
                    And volumes stared at him, and he at me.
