                            A Time to Talk

                When a friend calls to me from the road
                And slows his horse to a meaning walk,
                I don’t stand still and look around
                On all the hills I haven’t hoed,
                And shout from where I am, ‘What is it?’
                No, not as there is a time to talk.
                I thrust my hoe in the mellow ground,
                Blade-end up and five feet tall,
                And plod: I go up to the stone wall
                For a friendly visit.
